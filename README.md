# hello-world
Short description.

A little about me: I went vegatarian this year -something I never thought I'd do. I'm starting to learn to code - also something I'm surprised to find myself doing. For whatever reason, I'm super jazzed to be trying out a compost bucket for the first time. I just finished Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Jake Peralta is now my ideal man hahaha (minus the soul crushing debt). I do a lot of walking with my pup clementine, and wished she enjoyed being in my jeep as much as i do!
